1) In the xsd folder there is a file "schemaAss1A.xsd" with the diagram of my xml schema

2) i have choose to put IdentifiedEntity as sub element of Place and Vehicle to respect the fact that both are an identifiedEntity and respect the unique identified constraint in the system

3) to avoid redundancy origin/position/destination fields in vehicleType are keyref to place (placeId)

4) place have an element choice between gate,parkingArea and roadSegment: in this way all this types have some common fields of places and some specialized fields

5) connections are expressed with a isConnectedTo element in place. to avoid redundancy i have preferred to put only this field and not create another element connection (it will managed by the application)

6) the constraint "roadSegmentName is unique within a road" is done by making unique the tuple <RoadName,RoadSegmentName> and his unique id is the identifiedEntity becuse is a place

7) "At any time, each vehicle is in one place" can be retrived by the keyref in position field
